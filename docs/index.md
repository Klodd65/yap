# Yap
{: .fs-9 }

---


Recommended to use PHP 7.1 or greater.  PHP 5.6 is going to be end of life on December 31, 2018 and cannot guarantee compatibility after that.

Yap 3.x requires MySQL 5.5 or greater and an Apache-based webserver with `mod_rewrite` enabled.


The purposes of yap are :
* To be able to take the results of a BMLT root server and play it back through the telephone.  
* To be able to set up routing rules for zip codes and helpline numbers with optional extension dialing.
* To be able to set up volunteer schedules and associated rules to answer calls.

We are taking advantage of using Twilio which essentially handles all the VOIP parts.  You provision a number, set up an application, and point it your PHP server.
