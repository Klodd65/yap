## Upgrading from Yap 2.x to Yap 3.x

---


Follow the upgrade steps as you normally do above.  You will also need to follow item #8 under [Setup](../../general/setup/), to add the database configuration.

You can check that everything is functioning by going to the upgrade advisor http://your-instance/upgrade-advisor.php
